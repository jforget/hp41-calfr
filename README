Installation
------------

You need  a tool to  generate some files.   This tool can be  found in
another Git Hub repository.

https://github.com/jforget/perl-literate-prog-HP48-HP50

This  tool must  not  be installed  on  the HP  calculator,  but on  a
computer  (PC or  other). You  need other  software on  this computer:
Graphviz, Perl and the Perl modules YAML.pm and GrapViz.pm.

http://www.graphviz.org/
http://www.perl.org/
http://search.cpan.org/dist/YAML/
http://search.cpan.org/dist/GraphViz/

When all this is installed, run the command

genere-hpweb hp41-calfr

This generates several files including hp41-calfr.en.html.  The end of
the installation is explained in this file.  Read it in a web browser.
